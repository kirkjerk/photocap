photocap
========

A simple one-file editor for adding photo captions.

Copy `photocap.php` into a directory with .JPG images, then run

    php -S localhost:8000

http://localhost:8000/photocap.php will then show you your photos with editing boxes. Captions will be saved to `CAPTIONS.txt` and "deleted" files are moved to a "killem" folder.
